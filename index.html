	<h2>Globe and Scatter Plot</h2>
	<p>
	This globe shows the happiness of countries in the world using Gallup World Poll data. The scatter plot shows 
	the happiness score compared to one of six measured factors – economic production, social support, 
	life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The globes linear gradient color bar shows
	the happiness of each country according to a linear gradient color scheme with red being the least happiness to
	blue being the overall happiest. Both charts interact with each other. Click or hover on a country and the 
	country happiness data will show on the scatter plot.

	<h2>Context</h2>
	<p>
	<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness">KAGGLE</a><br>
		
	The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. 
	The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. 
	The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations 
	at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition 
	as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. 
	Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and 
	more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports 
	review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national 
	variations in happiness.

	<h2>Content</h2>
	<p>
	The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. 
	The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. 
	This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible 
	life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. 
	The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the 
	estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six 
	factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and 
	generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, 
	a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. 
	They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher 
	than others.
